# SMOTE_implementation

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) helps when the datset is imbalanced.
When a dataset has more samples of one class and very few of another, the model tends to predict the majority class more oftens. SMOTE helps to fix this issue by creating new synthetic samples for the smaller (minority) class.
